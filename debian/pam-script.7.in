.SH NAME
pam-script \- a PAM module that can invoke scripts within the PAM stack.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pam-script.so
.RI [ onerr=(success|fail) ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pam-script
allows you to execute scripts during authorization,
passwd changes, and on session opening or closing.

.PP
Such scripts can perform necessary tasks or influence the outcome of
the PAM stack.  For example, if the following entry was included
in
.I pam.conf
  sshd	auth	required	pam_script

then if the script,
.IR pam_script_auth ,
exits with a non-zero value this would cause the user to be
denied SSH access to the machine.

.PP
." TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
." \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
." respectively.
